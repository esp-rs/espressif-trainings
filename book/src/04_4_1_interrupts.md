# Building the Interrupt Handler

The goal of this exercise is to handle the interrupt that fires if the `BOOT` button is pushed.

You can find a skeleton code for this exercise in `advanced/button-interrupt/src/main.rs`.

You can find the solution for this exercise in `advanced/button-interrupt/examples/solution.rs`. You can run it with the following command:

```console
cargo run --example solution
```
## âœ… Tasks

1. Configure the [BOOT button](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board#ios) (GPIO9), using the `PinDriver` struct with the following settings:
    - Input mode
    - Pull up
    - Interrupt on positive edge
2. Instantiate a new notification and notifier
    - See `hal::task::notification` documentation
3. In an `unsafe` block, create a subscription and its callback function.
    - See `PinDriver::subscribe` and `task::notify_and_yield`
4. In the loop, enable the interrupt, and wait for the notification
    - The interruption should be enabled after each received notification, from a non-ISR context
    - `esp_idf_svc::hal::delay::BLOCK` can be used for waiting
5.  Run the program, push the `BOOT` button, and see how it works!

## Simulation

This project is available for simulation through two methods:
- Wokwi projects
  - [Exercise](https://wokwi.com/projects/360623288920412161?build-cache=disable)
  - [Solution](https://wokwi.com/projects/333374799393849940?build-cache=disable)
    - The Solution project contains solution for [Random LED Color on pushinig a Button](./04_4_2_interrupts.md)
- Wokwi files are also present in the project folder to simulate it with Wokwi VS Code extension:
   1. Press F1, select `Wokwi: Select Config File` and choose `advanced/button-interrupt/wokwi.toml`
      - Edit the `wokwi.toml` file to select between exercise and solution simulation
   2. Build you project
   3. Press F1 again and select `Wokwi: Start Simulator`
