# Preparations

This chapter contains information about the course material, the required hardware and an installation guide.

## Icons and Formatting We Use

We use Icons to mark different kinds of information in the book:
* ‚úÖ Call for action.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings, and details that require special attention.
* üîé Knowledge that dives deeper into a subject but which you aren't required to understand, proceeding.
* üí° Hints that might help you during the exercises

> Example note: Notes like this one contain helpful information

## Code Annotations

In some Rust files, you can find some anchor comments:
```rust,ignore
// ANCHOR: test
let foo = 1;
...
// ANCHOR_END: test
```
Anchor comments can be ignored, they are only used to introduce those parts of code in this book. See [`mdBook` documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mdbook.html#including-portions-of-a-file)

## Required Hardware

- [Rust ESP Board](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board): available on Mouser, Aliexpress. [Full list of vendors](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board#where-to-buy).
- USB-C cable suitable to connect the board to your development computer.
- Wi-Fi access point connected to the Internet.

> No additional debugger/probe hardware is required.

## Simulating Projects

Certain projects can be simulated, or at least partially simulated, with [Wokwi][wokwi]. Here is the list of projects that support Wokwi simulation:
- `intro/hello-world`
- `intro/http-client`
- `advanced/i2c-sensor-reading`
- `advanced/i2c-driver`
- `advanced/button-interrupt`

Before jumping into any simulation project, you need to [setup the extension][wokwi-installation]. To simulate one project:

1. Press F1, select `Wokwi: Select Config File`, and choose the `wokwi.toml` of the project you want to simulate.
   1. Edit the corresponding `wokwi.toml` file to simulate the exercise or the solution project.
2. Build your project in `debug` mode.
3. Press F1 again and select `Wokwi: Start Simulator`.

You can also [debug the project][wokwi-debug].

## Ensuring a Working Setup
<!-- TODO: Update this comments -->

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are participating in a training led by Ferrous Systems, we urge you to do prepare for the workshop by following the instructions in this chapter, at least, one business day in advance to verify you're ready to go by the time it starts. Please, [contact us](https://ferrous-systems.com/contact/) should you encounter any issues or require any kind of support.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using a [ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitc-02.html) a few pins and slave addresses are different, since the board is similar but not the same. This is relevant for the solutions in [advanced/i2c-sensor-reading/](/advanced/i2c-sensor-reading/examples) and [advanced/i2c-driver/](/advanced/i2c-driver/src/), where the pins and slave addresses for the ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 are commented out.
